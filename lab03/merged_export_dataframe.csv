Also changed Story.find to Story.findOne because if you clicked on a link like ""/stories/google"" and there was a ""/stories/google-1"" in the database Story.find would return both and end up sending the user to ""/stories/google"" then ""/stories/google-1"". The user would just see ""/stories/google-1"" since it happens so fast but you can see it in the cli.

Since only 1 result should be returned anyway (`exports.returnIndividualStory`), I figured using findOne would be appropriate.

Going forward - reason seems to be that jquery's .css() returns the _computed_ value for colors - i.e. it's running the tests using rgb(255, 0, 0) instead of ""red"" or hex values. It's also very picky and does want the spaces after the commas - rgb(255,0,0) does not work. (The docs used to say that you can use strings/hex; they have since been corrected.)

I've tested these changes by, instead of checking the `counter` against `challenges.length`, I checked it against `challenges.length + 1`, and it would finish all the same calls but not put me back in the shell, so just `challenges.length` should be the right amount of calls.

I also decied to do some other changes while in there:
- Removed the function's pseudo-class syntax (CapitalCamelCase and ended with a semicolon).
- Used named function instead of anonymous function in a variable; since it wasn't passed anywhere I decided to follow the same scheme as `getFilesFor()`.
- Shortened `if..else`-statement by removing unnecessary `return`.
- Incremented counter in `if..else`-statement instead of separately before, because looks.
- Added total calls to `console.log()`.
- Commented for good measure.

Oh, and I also found and abandoned `CompletionMonitor()`-function in `seed/challenge-migration.js`, so I removed it.

regex now allows opening style elements to have whitespace before closing '>', and also the allowed attributes (type, media etc..).
I also changed the text to read 'make sure all your style elements are valid and have a closing tag', since the regex only allows the allowed attributes (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)

*explanation about the regex: matches '<style' followed by zero or more occurrences of (any amount of whitespace + an allowed attribute + '=""anything""'), followed by any amount of whitespace + '>'.

Note that this regex is not perfect, and will allow any value for the attributes, and repeating of attributes (i.e <style type=""kuku"" type""maluku""> is matched)

The same applies to [Waypoint: Create a Set of Checkboxes](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-create-a-set-of-checkboxes) only here value of the `name` attribute is `personality`.

This PR also fixes another type of [issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/1017). Tests allow you to pass the challenges with this code.

``` html
<label>
<input type=""radio"" name=""indoor-outdoor"">indoor
<input type=""radio"" name=""indoor-outdoor"">outdoor<label> </label></label> 
```

and the same for checkboxes. So here one `label` is nested in another but instructions of waypoints' are very clear except [Waypoint: Create a Set of Radio Buttons](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-create-a-set-of-radio-buttons)'s one. I changed

The original first test was redundant, passing it solely makes the whole HTML invalid resulting in an odd user experience where all the tests disappear.

Along the way, someone has lenient-nified the document.ready test making it such that whitespace is now allowed so I'll chip in one last bit by making the script tag more lenient, we don't have to do the same since we ask users not to modify code above / below the script element lines in other tests but this particular test, it might be good to have as students have to type in their own script element and it's common to write:

```
<script type=""text/javascript"">
```

especially if they come with some web programming background so I think we should allow for it, thoughts?

Looks like this: http://prntscr.com/8vvgd7, two examples of gists: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/29ee0f9a9e21d34e78eb, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8a9f708ac77a7c002011.
A couple of words about the implementation. By clicking that ""create gists"" button a new blank window is opened. After that we perform an AJAX `post` request to `api.github.com/gists` with the appropriate data (`data` object). From `api.github`'s response we get the `html_url` of the newly created **anonymous** gist. Then we change the window's `location.href`.
You should notice two things:
1. These gists are anonymous because we need to get user's authentication info to make them authorized (and I've no idea how to do that). As @BerkeleyTrue said ""I don’t think there is going to be a way that we can share that information with the client side"" (if user's GitHub account is linked to user's FCC account).
2. The new window is going to be blank until we get the answer from `api.github.com/gists`.
This is done because the browser will normally block the window like any other pop-up. To avoid this we need to open the window immediately after the button click and do any manipulations (in this case changing `location.href`) after AJAX request.
Another way is performing a synchronous AJAX request but this will freeze the browser until GitHub's response.
Closes #1343.

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` in one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

Happy fixing and merging :palm_tree:

The drawbacks are that we can't shutdown a iframe like we could a web worker. This actually doesn't apply to use because we only used web workers in some situation, but we ran code in the main thread most of the time.

Details of the issue:
The following code used to fail as `img` tag spreads in multiple lines.

```
<img src=""some value""             
     href=""some link"">
```

It is supposed to be a test that is GREEN. So modified the regex to even consider new line elements and determine that `img` tag entered by user is valid.

Tested in local machine. Chrome-- both for 'logged in' users and 'not logged in' users.
To test in local machine, I removed completed challenges using mongo shell.
To remove the `completedChallenges` list in your database, in order to simulate that you are doing challenge/waypoint for the first time, I followed the following steps.
- Open mongo shell `mongo shell`
- `use freecodecamp`
- `db.user.find().pretty()`

In addition to fixing the issue, I edited some other things as well I hope are good:
- fixed spacing in the `if` statement (Lines 787 and 798)
- change double quotes to single quotes (Line 790s and 798)
- updated the solution with the changes as well (Line 798)

I'm not sure what is going on at Line 5144. It says previously there was no newline at the end of the file and presumably my edits added a newline. But there is no newline, otherwise I'd assume there'd be a Line 5145.

The typo lies in the example shown below (note condition1/statement1 repeated twice):

This is my attempt to fix loop-protect triggering in comment styled like 
`/* comment */`

this was occurring because loop protects function for checking multi-line comments ignores the line that the keyword, such as ""for"" was found on. I edited the function so that if an opening /\* and a closing */ were found on the same line. it will recognize that as a complete comment.

All tests are passing on my local machine. and the code in the issue now runs as expected

# Waypoint: Find Numbers with Regular Expressions
### Current Description:

```
""We can use special selectors in <code>Regular Expressions</code> to select a particular type of value."",
""One such selector is the digit selector <code>\\d</code> which is used to retrieve the numbers in a string."",
""It is used like this: <code>/\\d/g</code>."",
""For numbers this is often written as <code>/\\d+/g</code>, where the <code>+</code> following the digit selector allows this regular expression to match one or more numbers."",
```
### Improved Description:

```
""We can use special selectors in <dfn>Regular Expressions</dfn> to select a particular type of value."",
""One such selector is the digit selector <code>\\d</code> which is used to retrieve one digit (e.g. numbers 0 to 9) in a string."",
""In JavaScript, it is used like this: <code>/\\d/g</code>."",
""Appending a plus sign (<code>+</code>) after the selector, e.g. <code>/\\d+/g</code>, allows this regular expression to match one or more digits."",
""The trailing <code>g</code> is short for 'global', which allows this regular expression to find all matches rather than stop at the first match"",

This was an interesting issue. I've tried to reproduce and here is what I've got in my console:
![](http://i.imgur.com/PhrD1r0.png)
Here you can see that I'm redirected to the last place I've been, which is `/map-aside` (but `/map-aside` actually isn't where we want to be redirected). Then I searched `freecc:user:remote` in the entire codebase and one of the matches was in `common/models/user.js`. Then I searched `user logged in` and [found this](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/common/models/user.js#L175-L187):

``` js
return req.logIn({ id: accessToken.userId.toString() }, function(err) {
  if (err) { return next(err); }

  debug('user logged in');

  if (req.session && req.session.returnTo) {
    return res.redirect(req.session.returnTo);
  }

  req.flash('success', { msg: 'Success! You are logged in.' });
  return res.redirect('/');
});
```

As you can see here we're getting redirected to `req.session.returnTo`. By using `debug` funcs I've found out that:
![](http://i.imgur.com/PZRPbKT.png)
 `req.session.returnTo` actually is `/map-aside` and that is why I was redirected to `/map-aside`.

**UPD.**
Made a similar fix in [`server/middlewares/add-return-to.js`](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/server/middlewares/add-return-to.js#L39) so now this works not only for email login but for GitHub login too.

To that end I have added a check-sum calculation to the `node seed` process.  What this does is generates a 32 bit check-sum (using Adler's method) for the textual sum of the Title, Description, Challenge Seed, and Tests elements.  This check-sum is written to the database at seed time. (It's also calculated when a challenge is loaded from disk).

When information is sent to Google Analytics the check-sum is appended to the name of the challenge, separated by a tilde. It looks like:
`challenge-name~32165468`
This allows the check-sum to be easily extracted from the title with a simple split operation, as needed.
## Testing

I have tested locally to the extent that I can see that the check-sum is calculated and sent to GA, but I don't have an account set up, so I don't know what it looks like on the receiving end.

We should probably test on beta to make sure it gives the data we want.

Mostly I'm looking for feedback.  I think this may work ""as is"", but it probably needs extensive testing.  
## Longer Term

The great thing about this lightweight check-sum is that we can easily calculate it for any given commit and trace changes in specific challenges back to a specific version of the challenge.  I've got a script which does some of that already, just need to get it to go back in time.

Addresses some aspects of issue #5405.

Still more to do.

The wiki has changed significantly. I don't think we need the wiki challenge any more.

I gave the tribute project a creation date so it will be marked as new.

#### Description

When the iframe requests the `HTTPS://freecodecamp.github.io/wiki/en/python` page, it redirects to `HTTP://freecodecamp.github.io/wiki/en/python/` which, because it's a HTTP, gets blocked.

This adds a trailing slash to the iframe source if one doesn't exist already so that the page never redirects in the first place.

#### Description

Unsubscribes the user from all three types of emails regardless of the link they use to unsubscribe. Couple of concerns with the original issue that I think need to be addressed:
- This unsubscribes the user from _all 3_ (Quincy's newsletter, notifications, and announcements) types of emails because the original issue specifically mentioned all. Just wanted to ensure that this is the desired behaviour.
- I haven't done this but perhaps the copy should be updated to clearly state that the user was unsubscribed from all the emails (in the case they didn't actually intend to).

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

This commit:
- Updates the Local Weather challenge example back to the
  `http` URL because a hosted resource is served over http.
- Updates the Portfolio challenge pen from @hallaathrad 's copy.
- Updates the Force Directed Graph challenge with a `https`
  link to the Camper News API.

Tested locally.

> Additionally added a comment in the Pen to prevent future edits:

Currently searching in the map only works if you enter full words without skipping any characters.
Eg.
Search query: `build a tr` or `tribute p`
Result: `Build a Tribute Page`

This fix will allow entering query string by skipping characters too.
Eg.
Search Query: `bu tr pg` or `trbu ge` or `uil ibu pe` and so on..
Result: `Build a Tribute Page`

I edited the JSON to remove the quotation marks in the message at the bottom of the instructions. I ran this locally and it did work. I keep failing the npm test though because of .DS_Store I'm hoping that when i submit a pr github will automatically run those tests to prove it works without my silly .DS_Store(i've tried a lot to remove this problem)  If it doesn't pass please don't hate me, I'm trying.

Just a cosmetic fix. Getting my feet wet with my first ever PR ;)

…k with Placeholder Text. [Wiki link](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/fill-in-the-blank-with-placeholder-text)
And it does exactly that. Issue #8363 states what's wrong with saying that _lorem ipsum_ are the two first words of a passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome: it is not like that and it is not correct to have it on the description of the Challenge. This fixes it with a correct (and shortly informative) statement.

Added functionality to the Wiki button in the navbar. Also added a button to the challenge complete modal.

If you are on a challenge that is of type HTML, JS, or Bonfire, clicking the Wiki button in the navbar or the new button in the challenge completion modal will take you to the appropriate challenge page that often has a solution.

Clicking one of these buttons while not on an HTML, JS, or Bonfire challenge will take you to the wiki homepage, as specific pages for these challenges and steps often do not exist.

Known issue:
There are some challenges (I've found 5 so far) that do not have a corresponding wiki page and thus bring up a 404 in the wiki pane.

I first made a gif using LICEcap v1.26 showing how to disable automatic preview updating in CodePen, and uploaded it to imgur http://imgur.com/NU1KOzR. I then edited the basic-ziplines.json file under seed/challenges/01-front-end-development-certification. Here I added a note about why APIs shouldn't be called over and over, and detailed how to turn off automatic updating in CodePen so that doesn't happen. I ran all the tests locally and everything passed with flying colors. Have yet to add additional languages.

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

Issue #8524 reports that `padding: 5px` needed adding the the paragraph at the top of the map menu. In actual fact, the `.mapWrapper` was set to `position: absolute` causing the map menu contents to be shifted over to the right. Removing this property (so it will be set back to the browser default of static) re-aligns the menu & removes the issue from the map content. It also allows the accordion to span the width of the container.

_Note_: This fix goes hand in hand with line 143 of maps.less - the position property of `.map-accordion` has already been set to `relative` on the staging branch (live site is currently set to `position: absolute`). So once this fix along with the fix on line 143 is pushed, it should all sit properly again.

Tested this fix using Chrome Dev Tools with the Nexus 6P, Neuxs 5X and Galaxy S5.

using `button` instead of `div`, `div` can be styled to look like a `button`, but it does not behave as a `button` semantically, for example receiving focus, respect the `tab` order, trigger `click` event when `space` is pressed. Above all, for assistive technology, `div` will never be presented or read out as `button`. A visually challenged user will never know about those `CTA`s

#### Description

using `button` instead of `div`, `div` can be styled to look like a `button`, but it does not behave as a `button` semantically, for example receiving focus, respect the `tab` order, trigger `click` event when `space` is pressed. Above all, for assistive technology, `div` will never be presented or read out as `button`. A visually challenged user will never know about those `CTA`s

#### Description
1. Instructions were provided for two consecutive challenges in a single challenge, while the tests for [first challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/trigger-click-events-with-jquery) were testing only against a subset of its instructions.
   So removed the duplicate instructions.
2. Removed grammatical error in [this line](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/seed/challenges/01-front-end-development-certification/json-apis-and-ajax.json#L13) which wasn't part of reported issue.

#### Description

Updated tests regex 

**Earlier** test regex was looking for 'Math.random \* 10' with parentheses like '(Math.random \* 10)' which was causing the tests to not pass when 'Math.random \* 10' was used without parentheses e.g. - aliasing it with a variable e.g - 'var random = Math.random \* 10;' 

As a fix, Removed the condition of presence of parentheses around 'Math.random \* 10' .

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

The challenge ""Show Relationships with a Force Directed Graph"" asks campers to build a force directed graph based off relationships derived from the Camper News Feed. The Camper News Feed was recently removed, breaking existing solutions to the challenge.
This pull request replaces the challenge with a new one based on a dataset hosted on github.
The new challenge, ""Show National Contiguity with a Force Directed Graph"", uses countries as nodes, and these nodes are linked if the countries share a national border. The flag icons are loaded from a spritesheet generated at https://www.flag-sprites.com/. The dataset, hosted at https://github.com/DealPete/forceDirected, was adapted from a dataset downloaded from the Correlates of War Project (http://www.correlatesofwar.org/).
No libraries other than d3 were used.

#### Description

Currently, the `mongod` command does not work due to an incorrect alias in the `~./bashrc_aliases` file on the current C9.io image. The staff at C9 posted a solution to fix this, but it had not been added to FCC at present.

A link to the instructions was added, and a description of how to call `mongod` as `./mongod` was inserted. The `--nojournal` description was removed, as it is already present in the `./mongod` alias file that the instructions have you create.

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

Add test to make sure user doesn't use ES2015's `.endsWith()` method to solve the challenge.

I couldn't come up with a better test message. I wanted to be transparent on what the test is actually testing (as with any test) but if I wrote it anyway else, I felt like people might question and be confused by the vagueness of the message. If anyone has a better test message, I'm open to ideas.

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

This PR changes the instructions for the how-to-npm and learnyounode challanges.
The main change is to use a ""Blank"" template instead of a ""Node.js"" template when creating a workspace on C9.
With the ""Node.js"" template both challenges regularly broke. Especially the dist tag challenge from how-to-npm.
I also fixed some typos and instructions which weren't so clear to the user.

#### Description

Existing exercise checks for `$('#target3').addClass(""fadeOut"");` code written by user to match regex `/\\$\\(.#target3.\\)/g`. 
This becomes a problem when user writes correct code `$( '#target3' ).addClass(""fadeOut"");` - please note the space introduced and regex fails to match. The new regex `/\\$\\(\\s*.#target3.\\s*\\)/g` introduces checks for optional spaces. So now, `$( '#target3' ).addClass(""fadeOut"");` with spaces around selectors is no longer a problem. Optional spaces regex ensures it matches even when when user writes code without spaces around selectors.

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

**Problem:** In challenge record collection, like in #8970, almost every time, a user will get confused because they will follow instructions and write a line of code `collection[id][prop].push(value);` that is correct solution for the moment but will fail 2nd test. It fails 2nd test because while pushing a `track` to `tracks` property, `tracks` needs to exist and should be an array. This concept is not discussed at all in instructions and so comes as a surprise to the user.

**Solution:** We add an instruction:

```
If <code>\""tracks\""</code> is non-existent before you update it, create an empty array before pushing a track to it. 
```

This instruction should work as a food for thought and help deserving candidates to complete the challenge with this hint.

… Notation JSON: I revised the explanations from line 4322 to line 4328 in order to define JSON and provide brief explanations. I modified the code on line 4343 by adding quotation marks around the boolean value in order to format the object as valid JSON. This did not break the functionality of the existing published code (as of 6:15 PM on June 11, 2016) when I tested that, but please double check that. Further, for the title Record Collection: I revised the instructions from line 4502 to line 4506 in order to disambiguate the meaning of key from the meaning of property. I added to the notes from line 4510 to line 4511 to provide a link to MDN which explains the push method. I modified the code from line 4517 to line 4538 by adding quotation marks around the keys in order to format it as valid JSON. This change at first DID break the functionality of the existing published code when I tested it. So I changed line 4542 from var collectionCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(collection)); to var collectionCopy = JSON.stringify(collection);.

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

This is the first in a number of challenges that ask the user to create a function containing a ""console.log"" statement. To print the output from console.log to the output area, the console.log function must be captured and temporarily replaced by a custom function that outputs to the output area in addition to the user's dev console.
For this challenge, console.log is captured after the code is run (by code placed in the ""tail"" area), and the user's function is run a second time to display the console.log output in the output area. The strange behavior observed which prompted this issue is due to the user's function being run without any arguments.
It is easier to simply capture console.log in the ""head"", and uncapture it in the ""tail"", only running the function once. This is what is done in subsequent challenges, and I have modified this challenge to work like the others.

We render links for all challenges regardless of they have `challenge.name` or not. The solution checks for it and in its absence, renders `N/A` text.
To recommend: Please recommend if `N/A` is a good text or I should just render nothing making table cell empty.
To Test: I got all names using seed and haven't deleted a name in local db to see how it works. Although it is basic I'd appreciate if someone does it faster while I look at Mongo queries to see how they work.

Closes #8254

When viewing the map in mobile mode, especially landscape, there just wasn't much space allotted to view the panes.

In landscape mode, I made the buttons float next to each other and also moved up the text regarding challenges for certifications.

Also corrected spacing of the stylesheet for a few previous rules to make things more consistent.

This is the only string that will pass the challenge whereby the spaces or lack thereof needs to be precisely this:

``` js
var myStr = ""Here is a backslash: \\.\n\t\tHere is a new line with two tabs."";
```

**Add code tags into table**

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2754821/16175696/1fc27296-35ac-11e6-9b0c-311902ad9d06.png)

**Rewrite instructions for more applicable coding test**

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2754821/16175697/2f170072-35ac-11e6-9d11-abb231f3186f.png)

The text underneath the first code block made is a bit verbose. However, I wanted to be clear on the strictness of the spaces because in contrast, the current challenge is specific about having spaces between escape sequences.

I made the quoted text in quote rather than in a blockquote or code tags because I wanted to differentiate the escape sequence words from the rest of the text. I refer to the text as text and not a string to hopefully not confuse campers on needing to actually include quotations in their string.

**Add more tests to be more specific on what you need to pass**

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

In its current form, the instructions column in the challenges with a 2-column layout change from col-md-4 to col-lg-3 at 1200px. But this means that at a standard laptop width of 1280px, the instructions column is just 25% of the total width. So often I have to horizontally scroll to see code examples. I changed col-lg-3 to col-lg-4 (and col-lg-9 to col-lg-8 for the right-hand column), to widen the instructions column and avoid horizontal scrolling.

The only side-effect I can think of is that at very wide widths of maybe 1900+px, the instructions column might get rather wide, so some sort of max-width setting might make sense if you don't have one already, e.g. 1600px?

For the ""Replacing if else chains with switch"" challenge two typos were spotted.

The instructions and challenge description used the text ""if / if else"" which does match what the code syntax is of ""if / else if"".

This pull request corrects those typos by making the text in the instructions and description read ""if / else if"".

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

Found that if there was a syntax error in campers code, the test suite would `fadeOut`, but not `fadeIn` again. This left campers thinking the `Run tests` button was not working.

This is a temp fix. `fadeOut` highlights a bug where `display-test-results.js` breaks with syntax errors in campers code.

This fix is to allow some functionality while this bug exists.

Replaced occurrences of `gray`/`gray-background` in challenge ""Give a Background Color to a Div Element"" to `silver`/`silver-background` to address `gray`/`grey` ambiguity. This includes occurrences of the English word `gray` in description translations, but each language's word for ""gray"" is unchanged; ""silver"" is specified as the correct English word in each case and the silver color is similar enough to gray that this should be a reasonable approximation until each translation is reviewed.

**Challenge**: [Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/iterate-through-an-array-with-a-for-loop)

Relax test regex to accept the following three correct, but different ways to initialize `total = 0`.
- Within `for` loop after the index initialization

``` js
for (var i = 0, total = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
  total += myArr[i];
}
```
- Within `for` loop before the index initialization

``` js
for (var total = 0, i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
  total += myArr[i];
}
```
- Before the `for` loop

``` js
var total = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
  total += myArr[i];
}
```

To do so, I relaxed the regex looking for `var total = 0;` to look for that code with anything between `var` and `total` and anything between the `0` and the semi-colon

``` diff
- /var\\s*total\\s*=\\s*0\\s*;/
+ /var.*?total\\s*=\\s*0.*?;/
```

I also had to relax the last test that checks for the initialization of `total` equal to `20` to accept commas in the lookaround.

``` diff
- /total[\\s\\+\\-]*=\\s*(\\d(?!\\s*;)|[1-9])/g
+ /total[\\s\\+\\-]*=\\s*(\\d(?!\\s*[;,])|[1-9])/g
```

Desperate rewrite of [Manipulating Complex Objects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manipulating-complex-objects). There were lots of duplicate or redundant information that was leftover from a recent change. Also, I removed text and links that I found unnecessarily detailed for the scope of this challenge.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-eslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

function updateRecords(id, prop, value) {
  if(value !== """") {
    if(prop === ""tracks"") {
      collection[id][prop]= collection[id][prop] || [];
 collection[id][prop].push(value);

      collection[id][prop] = value;
    }
  } else {
    delete collection[id][prop];
  }

To fix those, Snyk created this pull request with the necessary changes to address the vulnerabilities.

This pull request includes:
- `package.json` scripts and a Snyk policy (`.snyk`) file, which patch the vulnerabilities that can't be upgraded away.

You can read more about Snyk's upgrade and patch logic in [Snyk's documentation](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/). Each vulnerability page (see below) includes information about the vulnerable versions, and direct links to the available patches.

This PR includes fixes for the following vulnerabilities:
- [npm:marked:20150520](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:marked:20150520)

See the Snyk [test report](https://snyk.io/test/github/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/HEAD) for this project for details.

Some of the vulnerable paths we found do not have a patch nor an upgrade available, and so will remain after merging this PR. You should manually review those issues, and can choose to ignore them by running [`snyk wizard`](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/#wizard) in the project's folder.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-eslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

When confirming completion of React and D3 it displays ""Front End Development Certificate requirements"" in the brown box when it should be ""Data Visualization Certificate requirements"" instead.

Also, it was using the brown background instead of FCC green. 

This updates the language to read ""Data Visualization Certificate requirements"". The image for ALL LANGUAGES was updated. Some of the images in the other languages were using the english versions, so I created the correct language in french and spanish for those.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Calculator project example update:

Previous calculator had several bugs that were addressed. Per Quincy Larson's request, this file has been updated to provide a new calculator example existing under Free Code Camp's CodePen profile that has corrected the following bugs in the previous calculator example:
1. Entry box is now limited so all numbers / operations in use are visible.
2. Corrected the use of operators - now you can not begin with an operator or use an operator twice in a row.
3. Corrected the use of the decimal - now you can only use the decimal once per number to be evaluated.
4. Corrected the use of zero - you now may not begin with or use multiple zeros unless it is in relation to a number with a decimal.
5. Corrected a bug where once you received an answer, you may continue using the answer in another equation.
6. Corrected a Clear Entry (CE) bug where once an equation's answer is returned, it does not All Clear (AC) if 'CE' is clicked.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-router-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Per the issue #9806 I removed the .toLowerCase() from the unshift() challenge and made all array challenges use strict equality with doing number comparisons to prevent strings from passing as numbers. I tested these 4 challenges locally and the tests appear to be valid.

Normalized GA event data in shop.jade, bindings.js, and main.js. Updated parameters in ga function calls. Changed category parameter to be separated by space with a capital word. Updated action parameter to be past tense in kebab-case and changed label argument to specify the related event for each function.

I added some CSS to client/less/main.less near the bottom of the file.  It makes it so you can scroll to see the overflow text on the iPad.  I tested it in the iOS simulator and seems to fix the issue.  Although I was kind of confused about how they wanted it fixed.  If they would rather the height of the text editor change for the iPad.  I can change it to that also if it's preferred, please let me know.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of connect-mongo.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

Here is a brief explanation of the code:
`ALLOWED_METHODS`: we only care about `GET`, this is an array in case we want to add other methods. Can be replaced by a string if you want.
`EXCLUDED_PATHS`: All those are excluded so we don't flash anything. We hit `/api/flyers/findOne` on every page request and this is excluded as well as `/challenges/current-challenge` because those will lead to duplicate flash messages. `/signout` is excluded to not to show a flash message after a cheater logs out.
`req.url !== '/'` is immediately after `req.user` because when a user is logged in `/` redirects to `/challenges/current-challenge` and that redirects to the current challenge. So we get three `GET` requests and thus three flash messages.
Below are some screenshots:
**Cheaters profile page, cheater is not logged in.**

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-uglify.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>errors:</strong> emit errors of type <code>GulpUglifyError</code> (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/commit/1232c3c"">1232c3c</a>)</li>
<li>
<strong>minifer:</strong> use <code>gulplog</code> for the warning (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/commit/5632cee"">5632cee</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Features</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<strong>minifier:</strong> use UglifyJS 2.7.0's input map support (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/terinjokes/gulp-uglify/commit/8160697"">8160697</a>)</li>
</ul>


<h3>BREAKING CHANGES</h3>


<ul>
<li>errors: Emitted errors are of a new type. Original UglifyJS
error message are preserved instead of the attempt to normalize them.
The constructor is exported as ""GulpUglifyError"" to allow for instance
checks.</li>
<li>minifier: Now requires UglifyJS 2.7.0 or greater to use the
input object support.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

This tests for the possibility that not all source keys have been properly checked against every object contained in the collection.

Previously, this resulted in [a faulty solution](https://repl.it/CLmj/0) (which did not always check all 'source' keys) passing the test. Details can be found where I've [corrected the solution](https://repl.it/CLmj/1): https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/pull/1246

It has also been referenced in the forum [here](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/algorithm-wherefore-art-thou/16092/2?u=sautille)

This PR updates the test case so a faulty solution does not pass all given tests.

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

This pull request fixes a small typo in a _Basic JavaScript_ challenge called _Comparisons with the Logical And Operator_ presented in [#10161 issue](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/10161). The description of the logic of one of 'if' statements was misleading and could cause problems. The closed range [6, 9] should be replaced with open range (5, 10), according to the code.

Replace challenge ""Slasher Flick"" with something a bit more challenging which requires users to understand and implement the array methods `.slice()` and `.splice()`.

The new challenge also reinforces the concept that some methods mutate the values they are called on (see discussion in #9944), while keeping the cinematic theme of the original challenge it replaces.

If present in uri (i.e. ?solution=function foo() {}). This will locks the challenge as running untrusted code until the user unlocks it manually.

If present in localStorage
- this checks first for the modern version, which uses the challenge id instead of title with 'Val' appended
- then checks for the legacy version,
  - i.e. 'Concat StringsVal', and converts it to the modern version
  - removes the legacy key

If both of the above find nothing, it then looks at the user challengeMap if available and pulls the previous solution.

When a user completes a challenge, the local copy is removed.

Adjusts tests for challenge ""Access MultiDimensional Arrays With Indexes"" by checking that a user uses the correct array indices to access the required value (rather than any digit), and that a user does not directly assign to `myData` a number or arithmetic expression.

This makes the final test redundant, so it is removed, and solutions involving assignment of the correctly-accessed value to a new variable and in turn assigning that variable to `myData` will still pass.

It uses npm 3 over npm 2 (travis default), and caches the
dependencies.

This is okay, because our prime two testing areas are, linting and
tests for the challenges.

NOTE: The speed up should happen from the second build,
as it will take at least one build to cache the dependencies.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of yargs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I changed the directions to the Exact Change challenge, as there was a common misconception users weren't catching about the conditions needed to return ""Insufficient Funds."" In addition to the existing sentence 

> Return the string ""Insufficient Funds"" if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due.

, I added this to it: 

> Return the string ""Insufficient Funds"" if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due or if you cannot return exact change.

to make it clear that if you don't have exact change (not just if you don't have enough money to return the change requested) you need to return ""Insufficient Funds.""

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

I added an if statement to check if the challenge is required or not before determining if the star will show up after the challenge is completed. To test this locally, I completed both a non-required and required challenge and this improvement achieves the desired behavior. My apologies for the earlier mistake.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-images.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

The Open Weather Map API was not serving over HTTPS, leading to mixed content issues, since geolocation requires HTTPS. Forecast.io's API is also free, requires sign up, but up to 1k hits per day w/ no charge or card on file.

I'm (unsurprisingly) not the first person to notice this. Seems to intersect w/ #7853 and #9145, the latter I believe it closes, at least accounts for it from the documentation side of things (as the currently recommended open weather map API leads to a funny experience, at least for Chrome users).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-react.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

Changed wikipedia links to spanish and russian wikipedia links when wiki pages existed. I searched for all en.wikipedia.org links with grep. Then went link by link to see if a spanish or russian version existed. There were only 5, and I thought there were going to be more. However there aren't. I also checked MDN, and there aren't any links that can be updated.

There was information lacking about `truthy` and `falsy` values. Additionally, links to MDN are included. The beta site has issues rendering MDN links so I cannot test that functionality locally, but I've formatted the links according to others so there shouldn't be any issues.

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
- Add tests which would make creating solutions easier by looking at tests.
- Refactor previous solution to use a declarative solution (_functional programming paradigm_).

**Updated Solution**

function sym() {
  var arrays = [].slice.call(arguments);
  return arrays.reduce(function (symDiff, arr) {
    return symDiff.concat(arr).filter(function (val, idx, theArr) {
      return theArr.indexOf(val) === idx 
        && (symDiff.indexOf(val) === -1 || arr.indexOf(val) === -1);
    });
  });
}
sym([1, 2, 3], [5, 2, 1, 4]);
```

**Previous Solution**  

``` js
function sym(args) {
  var index = -1;
  var length = arguments.length;
  var result;
  while (++index < length) {
    var array = arguments[index];
    result = result ? diff(result, array).concat(diff(array, result)) : array;
  }
  return result ? uniq(result) : [];
}

function uniq(arr) {
  var h = Object.create(null);
  var u = [];
  arr.forEach(function(v) {
    if (v in h) return;
    h[v] = true;
    u.push(v);
  });
  return u;
}

function diff(a, b) {
  var h = Object.create(null);
  b.forEach(function(v) {
    h[v] = true;  
  });
  return a.filter(function(v) { return !(v in h);});
}

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-fontawesome.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

See the [Snyk test report](https://snyk.io/test/github/freecodecamp/freecodecamp) for this project for details.

The PR includes:
- `package.json` scripts and a Snyk policy (`.snyk`) file, which patch the vulnerabilities that can't be upgraded away and ignore vulnerabilities with no fixes.
#### Vulnerabilities that will be fixed
##### With a [Snyk patch](https://snyk.io/docs/security/#snyk-s-process-for-creating-patches):

- [npm:uglify-js:20151024](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:uglify-js:20151024)

Note that some vulnerabilities couldn’t be fully fixed and weren’t explicitly ignored, and so will still fail the Snyk test report.

You can read more about Snyk's upgrade and patch logic in [Snyk's documentation](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/).

This adds a /welcome view which it directs new signups to. This view explains what to do if a duplicate account has been created (this happens all the time). It also gives campers a chance to skip our onboarding if they're in a hurry.

It also removes the notice about verifying their email address, since this is something they can do later.

#### Description

I've changed the format of ""override"" in the description from `<code>` to `<em>`. Also changed the same for other translations as well.
Though there was another PR already submitted by @alexanderholman, I'm going ahead and submitting as I've taken care of the translations as well, if its any worth.
Sorry for the delay as this was my first time ever open source contribution. Though the fix itself was so small, it took a while to setup freecodecamp and figure out the process.

Three sections with QA edits:
1) Applied accessibility: intro text put in slide format, rest of text formatted so consistent with other sections
2) Visual Design: removed Font Awesome icons in animation challenges, replaced with CSS-only graphics. Added intro text into slide format. Removed all logos and other images not under CC license. Retested challenge tests where they changed.
3) Responsive Web Design: text formatting, swapped logos for FCC images (in process), and checked all challenge tests working properly.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of validator.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

An issue with `min-width: 1%` seemed to be causing the button issue so I changed that to `inherit`. And an attribute of `overflow-y: auto;` was making the triple scroll bar issue on Firefox (and Chrome in my experience) so I removed these. I've tested on Mac Chrome, Firefox, and Safari and changed the display size and these changes don't seem to affect anything else negatively. I haven't tested on Windows FF or IE.

As for deleting the search bar in FF, I added a `e.preventDefault()` that got it working. Took way too long to figure out it was something so simple...

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
- only tested locally for Twitter as I can't get LinkedIn to work on my local
- after unlink, user is redirected to `/username`, actually I expect it to be redirected to `/settings` but there is a bug when doing that, see #10879
- I use `user[social] = null;` instead of `user[social] = undefined;` because rejected by `js-lint`: `Unexpected use of undefined  no-undefined`. Let me know your thought

I updated the Map.jsx file with a variable that changes depending on if the map is generated in a drawer or not. I updated the CSS to apply the fixed classes to the map when it's not in the drawer. The margins are a bit hackish but it's the only way I could get it to work since both the drawer map and full page map use the same module.

#### Description

The regex now accounts for the error encountered by user where `Math.random() * 100` was considered a valid entry.
This is my first PR into FreeCodeCamp's repo, so would appreciate any feedback. I've also got a question/suggestion and a comment:

**Question/suggestion:**
I've looked through the code and couldn't find where this is being tested with a negative expectation. E.g. `100` should _not_ pass. The lack of such tests are the reason this bug occurred, imo, and it would be great to have some safe guards against it.

So, something like this could be possible:

```
""solutions"": [
  ""var randomNumberBetween0and19 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);\nfunction randomWholeNum() {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);\n}""
],
""failingExamples"": [
  ""var randomNumberBetween0and19 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);\nfunction randomWholeNum() {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);\n}""
]
```

If I have not noticed where it is already implemented, my apologies in advance!

**Comment**
I just wanted to say that the setup instructions that you provided and ease of setup are really awesome. Maybe I was lucky this time, but I literally spent just 15 minutes setting the whole project up locally, and I'm not even a node pro! 👏

Change the order tests are run to Top, Right, Bottom, Left.
Previous they were ordered as Top, Left, Right, Bottom.

Why: The Tests, in the order run, form a checklist of the items the student needs to perform in order to pass this challenge.
The order they were listed is not only unnatural, but is not the order they need to memorize and write their code in later.
Reordering the tests to the proper Top, Right, Bottom, Left format prepares them to think, and act in that order and aids in future memorization of the sequence.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-sourcemaps.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of eslint-plugin-import.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

I've started contributing to FreeCodeCamp about a week ago. When I started contributing, I also joined the Contributors chat room. From my own experience and the experience of many other new contributors, I've found there's an issue in the `npm run only-once` command. `\n` on Windows doesn't add a new line. In fact, it's even worse. In the script, it seems to break. This pull request removes the new lines. I realize that this does make these little messages harder to catch. I think the trade-off is worth it, though. Because there is no new output for a while after the first message, and the last message is the very last thing logged, they're still hard to miss. I did some research on getting newlines in the command line on Windows, but there doesn't seem to be an easy cross-platform solution.  
I hope this will help out new contributors, taking one more bump out of the road of contributing to a large open source project. 🔥

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

Changing 'because' to 'and' alters the sense of the sentence ""These conditions are known as `Boolean` conditions because [and] they may only be true or false."" ""Because"" implies that the name `boolean` inherently implies truthiness or falsiness, which is not the case, and even if it has come to have that association for developers and mathematicians, new programming students with no development or mathematical background would not make that association.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of yargs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

#### Description

<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

In [/client/saga/err-saga.js#7](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/client/sagas/err-saga.js#L7), the dispatched action has type `app.makeToast` but there is no this type name in the project. I looked into [/common/app/redux/types.js](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/common/app/redux/types.js) which contains all the action types with prefix `app`, and `makeToast` is no where to be found. So I use the action creator from [/common/app/toasts/redux/actions.js](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/common/app/toasts/redux/actions.js) instead.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of loopback-connector-mongodb.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

On the live site, pressing Ctrl or Cmd + / comments and uncomments the code. I really love this feature. This functionality is no longer present in the beta. I did a little bit of git-digging, but I wasn't able to find where it disappeared. I decided to try to add it back in, and see if it would work. Surprisingly, it worked fine! Credits to @gangachris for originally adding this in #9854 👍 
_Edit: I wasn't sure whether this was a feature or a fix._

Part one of fixing `npm test` on Windows (#10885). By replacing `jsonlint` with `jsonlint-cli` (as suggested by @BerkeleyTrue) we fix the json linting on Windows. `jsonlint` was failing because it doesn't handle glob paths (paths with a \* in them). This is one of the main things mentioned by `jsonlint-cli`, it seems we're not the only ones with this issue 😄
The `-q` option is removed. `jsonlint-cli` does not support this option, rather it doesn't log anything by default as long as there are no errors.

Part 2/2 of fixing the test suite on Windows (#10885). 
For some reason, the single quotes trip Windows out. It errors without explanation. Using escaped double quotes fixes this issue.
Combined with #11407, this fixes the full test suite on Windows (I now need to wait a lot longer than running just `npm run test-challenges` 😄 ). [I made a new branch](https://github.com/systimotic/FreeCodeCamp/tree/fix/full-test) in my fork where you can check out the combined changes. When both of these fixes are merged, #10885 and #10888 can be continued.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of frameguard.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

- Removes bower
- Ports dependencies that were required through Bower to `npm`.
- Ads CDNs for CSS files

Some thoughts on future improvements (would love to hear what you guys think about these!):
- Replace `npm` with `yarn`
  - Super easy transition, for most cases
- Remove CDNs for libraries like `font-awesome`, `codemirror` and `bootstrap`. These can be loaded and served by webpack.
  - Right now CDNs for `font-awesome` alone are in 12+ places. And require two different versions, I can imagine that's not ideal to manage.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of history.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As babel-core is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
This PR updates the link to the old [wiki article](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Using-MongoDB-And-Deploying-To-Heroku) on deploying MongoDB to Heroku, which is now deprecated. The new link points to the corresponding article on the [forum](http://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/guide-for-using-mongodb-and-deploying-to-heroku/19347) instead. 

This problem was originally [mentioned](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/issues/11372#issuecomment-257170744) in #11372. That issue itself has been closed since, as it originally dealt with another problem, that has been resolved through a different PR. 

A few things about this PR - 

1. I did not check the ""_PR targets the staging branch_"" checkbox because this change already exists in the `staging` branch. I was told to target the `backup/staging` branch instead, as this is (kind of) the production site.

2. The issue where this problem was mentioned in, is already closed. So I just mentioned the issue number in the PR template, I did not create a separate `closes XXXXX` comment, as is the norm.

Thanks!

In the basic javascript challenge ""Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator"", the code the final return statement was `return ""9 or Under""`.  This code ran if the argument variable was not greater than or equal to 10.  The string does not accurately reflect that the argument could be greater than 9, but less than 10.  All instances of `return ""9 or Under""` were changed to `""Less than 10""`",4,1,1,5.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

Not clear if this is just a local issue.)

#### Description

@cmal faced some errors running Free Code Camp, as he shared in [this Gitter message](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors?at=582f95d4e712c9a11884ec9c). Today (in my timezone, this is technically the same day 😄), I was installing Free Code Camp with @tearingItUp786, and we faced the same errors. As it now was obvious to me this was definitely not an environment issue or user error, I decided to investigate.
This error prevents all Javascript from loading, which makes it impossible to test out anything you develop.
With the help of @cmal, I found that the cause was in react-hot-loader, and the way it interacts with React. The most recent version of React is `15.4.0`, which is allowed by our package.json (`^15.0.2` takes the most recent `15.x.x`). That had a change that made it incompatible with react-hot-loader version `1.x.x`, which is what we're using.
This change was very recent, and according to Google, more people have struggled with this starting about three days ago.
This is fixed in react-hot-loader v3, but that's still in beta. According to the creator however, it's more stable ([source](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/417#issuecomment-260995694)). I decided to try to upgrade to this version and see if things would work. It seems like it does!
I'm not familiar with how the hot reloading used to work. With the current state of things, it's hard for me to find out. From what I can tell, it seems to work as it should, but a thorough test by someone who really knows how this is supposed to work would be much appreciated.
I'm not a fan of using a beta version, but as it's more stable according to the creator, and because currently it just doesn't work completely, I believe that this is the best solution.

I view this bug as quite high priority, as any new contributors can currently not get started.",4,16,1,127.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

</table>

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As gulp-sourcemaps is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-codemirror.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Hello there human!

The other day, I was looking at the CONTRIBUTING.md file, when I noticed a typo! 😱 _I have to fix this!_
After I opened the file, I ended up fixing and tweaking some other things as well. Here's a summary:
- My editor (Atom) automatically removed some trailing spaces
- There was only a single ""I"" in the entire file. I changed it to be more consistent.
- The Contributors chat room on Gitter is referenced as ""Contributors chat room,"" ""Contributors Chat Room"" and ""Contributors room"", sometimes as a link, sometimes not. I edited some cases to be more consistent.
- The ""How to find the code in the Free Code Camp codebase to fix/edit?"" was in the PR section. I moved it near ""Make changes"" to hopefully be easier to find and harder to miss.
- With the current state of the project, after making changes to the seed files, you need to run `node seed` for them to be visible. This was never mentioned in this file. I added a section that talks about this. I assume it wasn't there because it previously updated automatically. I hope this helps resolve a common confusion among new contributors.
- Previously, the test section mentioned running a different command on Windows to test. This has been fixed (ref #10885), so I removed that part.
- The linting section mentioned that lines shouldn't be longer than 80 characters because of jsonlint. I'm not sure why or how that ever worked. As the name might suggest, jsonlint only lints the JSON. The linting talked about in this section only lints the .js and .jsx files. There is no maximum line length in the JSON files. I have tested this, it doesn't break. I removed this section because it seemed to be false information. 😅 Apart from that, it seems weird to me to only detail a single rule out of alllll of them.
- These last two are really nitpicking. I fixed the casing on a username. I also switched the order of two items in an unordered list to match the headings that followed it.

I know it's not such a great idea to stuff many different things into a single PR, but once I got started, I couldn't stop myself 😊

Have a great day! 🔥 ",4,3,6,31.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

While completing the Friendly Dates challenge, I noticed that none of the test cases ensure that dates in the twenty-thirty range actually end in the correct suffix (ex. 21 should be 21st). In other words, prior to this PR, a camper could write a switch that only targeted number 0-19, which doesn't reflect the requirements of the challenge.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of babel-istanbul.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Just adds a docker-compose.yml file.

It allows you to quickly spin up a couple of Node and Mongo containers, 
which might be useful in several scenarios, trying out stuff from scratch
without having to deal with installing MongoDB or cleaning the DB.

It might come in handy for CI/CD testing as well.

Bootstrap with:
```
   docker-compose run --rm server npm install
   docker-compose run --rm server npm run only-once
```

Run with:
```
   docker-compose up

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
It's me again, with another module update + webpack related issue that prevented the bundle from successfully compiling (see #11718 for last time).

This time around, it was an issue with `babel-core` using `debug` improperly, which made things break in a SemVer minor update. A patch was done (https://github.com/visionmedia/debug/issues/389), but we had a module replacement in our webpack config that made things break. This was not restored in the patch.

I changed this replacement plugin to replace with `debug` instead of `debug/browser`, which is the recommended way to use the module. It detects if you're in a browser automatically.

Across all of the modules (this includes the backend), Free Code Camp is dependent on three versions of `debug`: `2.2.0`, `2.3.3` and `2.5.3`. This change should work fine with all of these versions. There are currently three references to `debug/node` in our `node_modules`. One of them is from `babel-core`. 
The other two are in `avj`, a sub-sub-dependency of `eslint`. Interestingly, this module is not dependent on `debug`. The references are in a minified file in the `dist` directory. `eslint` is never processed by webpack, so whatever this module does not matter for this PR.

From what I can tell, everything works fine, but I'm not 100% certain.

Updated this and tested it with a short code snippet. Seems to work fine. Interestingly, the recommendation on the uuid readme.md to use `require('uuid/v4')` instead of `require('uuid')` doesn't seem to work so I left it as the latter. Also, `1.4.3` was not an acceptable version number for the package.json so I made it `^1.4.2`",3,5,0,6.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

### Things that work great now
- Strings actually show up as strings
- Previously, `undefined` and `NaN` were converted to `null`. They now stay as is.
- Objects are prettified.
- Arrays get an extra space, like they have in the browser console.

### Things that aren't perfect yet
_Nested arrays are now recursively parsed._
- ~Nested arrays and~ property values are still handled by `JSON.stringify`, so they still have the `NaN` -> `null` issue.
- All strings that start with // are displayed as comments.
- ~The indentation of indented arrays doesn't necessarily have to be this way. I guess it comes down to our preference.~
- If there is a lot of logging output, the performance hit may be too big. This change doesn't affect that a whole lot though. It might be good to not log anything larger than `x`.


~Tests are still broken as per #12305. I ran them with the fix from #12317, and they passed.~ Tests have been fixed",3,3,4,54.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

#### Description
Updates one of the phone numbers used in the tests to avoid thinking it might be an invalid number. Also updates the description of the problem to be more clear that we're validating the format rather than a more sophisticated test that the number actually exists.

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
Clarification of instructions to better match the test cases. Replace this paragraph, in the original wording:

> If multiple pairs are possible that have the same numeric elements but different indices, return the smallest sum of indices. Once an element has been used, it cannot be reused to pair with another.

Which seemed to suggest that in the test case pairwise([0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], 1)===10 only the pair of indices {0, 4} should be used, to fit the criterion 'if multiple pairs are possible ... return the smallest sum of indices.' However, the expected behavior of the test is that indices {0, 4} and {1, 5} should both be used.

To reflect that, the paragraph is replaced with:

> You may use multiple pairs that have the same numeric elements but different indices. Each pair should use the lowest possible available indices. Once an element has been used it cannot be reused to pair with another element.",3,2,0,1.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
Changed the function call from `findOne()` to `update()` with the `multi` parameter set to `true`. This approach no longer requires the extra step of updating the attributes of the user that was found using the `findOne()` function call. Rather, in one function call, we can update the appropriate attributes of all users that have the same email address. Also, because the update function returns a counter that indicates the number of users that were found, the ""Email address not found."" error can still be displayed when the counter is equal to zero.",4,7,7,178.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-addons-css-transition-group.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of react-addons-shallow-compare.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

I fixed the checkbox challenged where the div.row test would pass erroneously. I also found another bootstrap challenge that had this exact issue. The challenges asked for a certain amount of elements to be nested inside of the div.row, but the test would pass by passing only one or more regardless of how many the challenge asked for.

similar issue: [(Use the Bootstrap Grid to Put Elements Side By Side)](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-bootstrap-grid-to-put-elements-side-by-side)

 I did not find any other issues in this file with counting nested elements inside the div.row.

Changed copy for challenge ""Count Backwards with a For Loop"" so that all occurrences of ""backwards"" were consistent. Also, re-worded a couple of other bits of the challenge for a smoother overall read. Ran these changes by @HKuz before making them, and we were in agreement on them. 

Lastly, added `<code>` tags around the first instance of ""for"" to keep consistent with the rest of the challenge. 

**NOTE:** there still may be inconsistencies in the translated versions of this challenge, but I'm not the right guy for that job.",2,0,1,3.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

Partial completion of issue #12472 - for replacing all instances of `Free Code Camp`, `FreeCodeCamp`, etc. with ""freeCodeCamp"" within the codebase.

This PR targets all instances within the `freeCodeCamp/server/` directory. 

Also, @raisedadead as this is a new PR (closed my last attempt at this without merging), I did touch the `views` directory to hit instances of `FreeCodeCamp` that were left in there (all of `free code camp`'s were already replaced). Lastly, if there is an issue with having email domains not cased correctly, I did notice these instances:
```js
/Users/peter_weinberg/Code/freeCodeCamp/server/boot/certificate.js:
  112    const notifyTeam = {

The markdown files use URLs to link to various other pages/platforms. In cases where the platform has been renamed accordingly, like `https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp`, I have made the corresponding change in the linked URLs as well. However, some other platforms are not yet renamed, like Gitter - `https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors`, YouTube, the forum, etc. So I left it as is.

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
- Added styling to Community dropdown menu per #12538
- Also added styling to all nav bar items for `:active` and `:focus` states, as before they were still day mode colors
- Used existing nightmode and brand colors only (`@gray`, `@night-text-color`, `#666` & `@link-hover-color`)
- Also, while I was at it, fixed the padding on `<dfn>` tags within `.challenge-instructions` to match the padding on `<code>` tags, as this has been nagging at me for a bit, previously there was no padding and it looked a little funny.
- Examples of both below.

Changed the word 'swell' to the word 'well' in Basic Javascript challenge ""Constructing Strings with Variables."" While the usage of 'swell' is probably fine, non-native English speakers may find it less unnatural to use the word 'well', and 'swell' is just uncommon enough in modern usage for 'well' to be a better word choice for native speakers.

#### Description

Upgrades jquery to 3.1.1 (major version upgrade).

I used [this official guide](https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#breaking-change-load-unload-and-error-removed) to upgrade API. I have tested some of the pages, including some of the challenges. I would be glad to help with more testing if someone who knows the app well can lay out a plan. From reading the upgrade doc, it didn't appear that the repo had a bunch of deprecated API, though.

Notes:
- lightbox2 library throws a warning during bower build that it requires JQuery 2. I let this one go, because [there hasn't been any issues reported](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/issues/525) and JQuery 3 seems to work fine with this library.",2,3,0,187.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
This is a partial completion of issue #12693 - since there is a lot here, I am going one section at a time - this PR is only for the Array challenges. 

There was a lot to be done here:
- array challenges were put in standard FCC format using:
  - `code` tags for language keywords
  - `dfn` tags for key terms
  - `blockquote`s for examples, etc. 
- Fixed the way the test cases were being displayed by adding `'message: ...`
- Replaced all ""Instructions"" `h4` headers with `hr` elements as discussed in #12688
- Re-ordered array challenges to match the map laid out in Curriculum Expansion issue [#90](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/CurriculumExpansion/issues/90#issuecomment-270932804)
- Added Bracket Notation challenge which was missed during seeding
- Refactored Create Complex Multi-Dimensional Arrays challenge & tests
- Other bits and pieces of re-factoring along the way

I've run through all of the Array challenges locally (multiple times) and there are no obvious bugs that I can see. I will continue on addressing #12693 and the remaining Object challenges in another PR.

@HKuz I know you are totally swamped, but if you get the chance, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the Array section!",4,2,0,2.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
This is a partial completion of issue #12693 

This PR:
- Title case array challenges
- Reformat Object challenges to FCC format:
  - `code` tags for language keywords
  - `dfn` tags for key terms
  - `blockquote`s for examples, etc. 
- Fixed the way the test cases were being displayed by adding `'message: ...`
- Replaced all ""Instructions"" `h4` headers with `hr` elements as discussed in #12688
- Added `console.log()` around all function calls to log the result in the FCC challenge console
- Other reformatting and refactoring to prevent challenges from being cheated, etc. 

I've worked through this entire section locally and all tests pass and I can see no obvious bugs. This completes what the issue was originally opened for and I would say these are pretty well QAd at this point, but still leaving the original issue open for the time being in case there are a couple of other small things to be done. @bonham000, as discussed, if you want to go over the array section and see if there's anything you'd like to add...",3,1,1,13.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

- Verified tests for many of the challenges.
- Moved all sorting algorithms to the adv. algorithms section and tested these.
- Improved formatting/styling of text in several places.

Haha, so this is a bit awkward. I had seen this pop up multiple times (or so I thought), so I decided to just start working on it. Then I checked when creating the PR, and I couldn't find an open issue on this 😅 I'm not the only one that thought there was an issue about it: #12693 😄

As described in the issue, the closing backticks for a codeblock are indented, which makes them display as code.
It appears that there's an issue with dedent. I tried adding newlines before it both as lines that were empty in the editor and as `\n`, but it did not help.
I switched the code from dedent to good old string concatenation, which works fine.

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->

The [Quoting Strings with Single Quotes](http://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/challenges/basic-javascript/quoting-strings-with-single-quotes) challenge was affected when `'use-strict'` was added to the comment that is invisible to users. Similar to the issue seen in #12722. This challenge uses a regex to count the quotes in the `code` variable, so `'use strict'` and the `tail` was throwing off the count. Logging `code` looks like this:
```
<script>

;/*fcc*/
'use strict';

var myStr = '<a href=""http://www.example.com"" target=""_blank"">Link</a>;';
;/*fcc*/

(function() { return ""myStr = "" + myStr; })();

;/*fcc*/
</script>
<!--fcc-->
```

So there is an additional pair of both `'` and `""`. I tried to just accommodate for this by changing the test to account for the extra quotes, but my guess is that since this comment is not actually generated in nodes test environment, approaching it this way caused running `npm test` to fail.

So instead, I created an IIFE that executes within the assert and returns `true` or `false`. It slices `code` down to only the relevant parts then just runs the original regex matches against the new string.

I also added `blockquote`s for the examples to be consistent with other challenges and added `Do not change anything else.` to the instructions because we are also testing that the string remains unchanged in the first test but don't explicitly say it anywhere, so if someone does what the tests ask but changes the URL in the string, the tests will fail with an erroneous error message.

Added `e` as a hotkey to focus the editor, and `esc` to unfocus the editor.

`e` has been bound to `keyup`, because otherwise the letter 'e' would show up in the editor. I think this is fine, as you're going to have to release it before you can continue typing anyway.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gulp-notify.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Implements @erictleung's suggested changes from [#9651 (comment)](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/9651/files#r71084020).

This solves the issue mentioned above, but I'm still not happy with the result. Ideally, campers should be able to add `console.log(timesFive(someNumber))` to test their function and see the result in the simulated console to the left on their screen.

However, it's currently only possible to see this test output when the challenge is freshly loaded from the seed (either by visiting it for the first time or by resetting it). As soon as tests has been run, all that's displayed is 
```txt
// running test
// tests completed
```

I'm open for any suggestions!",6,3,14,205.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

Since algorithm challenges aim to help campers practice creating algorithms, we recommended their own solutions over those built into the language. This PR adds a test that prevent the most straight-forward forms of cheating by using `String.repeat()`.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of dedent.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Progress towards issue #12698, which is a compiled list of QA tasks for the new ES6 section introduced in beta

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
* Updated instructions to fixed spelling/grammar mistakes and performed minor rewording for clarification.
* Improved overall formatting of instructions by adding multi-line blockquotes for example code and by formatting inline code to identify variables and keywords in the instructions text.
* Changed titles of challenges to better conform to the format used in the titles in the Basic Javascript section where appropriate.
* Where appropriate, made minor changes to the challengeSeed syntax to conform with freeCodeCamp style guidelines (e.g. added a few semicolons, added spaces between function statement and function block, etc.) without changing functionality.
* Made no improvements to the functionality of the tests for any of the challenges. That is still needed in some cases.

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
This PR is a partial completion of issue #12472.

This mainly targets `seed` files, but I ran a search when I was finished with that directory and found a couple of nagging left over little buggers in other areas of the codebase, so I went ahead and fixed those as well.

I've replaced every instance (visible to the user) of `Free Code Camp`, `free code camp`, `FreeCodeCamp`, `freecodecamp`, and `FREE CODE CAMP` with the much more highly desirable `freeCodeCamp` - except in irrelevant URLs not visible to the user or where required by challenges (ex. regex challenges include other cases in  tests). I did hit some URLs (only the ones that we've changed, i.e. github, codepen), and, I even got the issue template! 

I did mention in #12472 that I did leave a few instances of `freecodecamp` in the Twitch challenge, because not sure how the API would interpret the case change. Also, our name has not yet been changed on Twitch, and we may have left that out of the change plan (looks like we're still FreeCodeCampin' over there! 😜  ).

Anyway, one step closer to putting this issue to rest finally!  ",3,7,6,21.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
Fixed challenge test in Applied Visual Design: Decrease the Opacity of An Element.
Correct answer was causing a failure in Safari due to precision error. Used Assert.approximately() to fix issue. Confirmed correct answer now passes in both Safari and Chrome.

Before in Safari (Correct answer does not pass):

NOTE: Original issue was observed in Mozilla, which turned out to be a different issue that might be resolved once other merges in the pipeline happen. This pull request is addressing the issue with Safari only, as decided in the issue conversation. See conversation in issue #13014 for more detail.

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
Prevent campers from using the built in `Object.keys()`, since the purpose of the challenge is to use `for...in` combined with `Object.hasOwnProperty()`, to understand what own properties mean, and how to handle them.

**Note:** Breaking change, since it prevents use of `Object.keys()`, which was a valid solution before.

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
Rewrote the challengeSeed for the ""Compare Scopes of the var and let Keywords"" ES6 challenge to:
* Reduce the complexity of the challenge, which better highlights the different scopes assigned to the variables declared with `var` or `let`.
* Avoid the dubious coding practice of defining a function within a for loop and the associated linting error in the challenge's code.

Additional Changes:
* Expanded the ""note"" section to include a statement saying that in your own programs its probably best to use different names for the variables to avoid confusion.
* Added test case placeholders. These will need to be addressed in the future once transpiling issues are resolved.
* Very slight rewording of instructions.",4,9,6,90.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

GitHub does not seem to be highlighting my changes very well, so reviewers, please read through both for details. I think this improves the flow of the challenge, though, and fixes the following:
- various language and grammar issues
- wrapped variable and code references in `<code>` tags
- separated one long paragraph into 2 shorter ones to make it a bit less daunting
- clarified challenge instructions
- changed confusing wording in assertion error",3,6,12,158.0,freeCodeCamp,freeCodeCamp

- added the class `.challenge-instructions` to the `<Row>` component surrounding the function that renders challenge instructions in the new backend challenge component

- this will also allow us to use `<dfn>` tags in this section which previously would not have formatted correctly

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
Removed code tags from the challenge seed, which were causing some tests to fail. Also added code tags around the ES6 function syntax in `description`, to be consistent with the example above it.

--- 
UPDATE - 

Improved the code formatting in `description`, as per Eric's suggestions. Here's the latest changes -

#### Description
<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->
As the OP points out in their issue, using the `i` flag shouldn't really matter much when the regex is `\w`. I made a [JS Bin demo](https://jsbin.com/toheje/edit?js,console) with all the test cases using only the `\g` flag, and all the tests returned the expected results. So, the `i` flag requirement could probably be dropped.

Tested locally - challenge passes without `i` flag -
